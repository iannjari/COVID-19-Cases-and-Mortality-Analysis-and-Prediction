
PROJECT TITLE: COVID-19 CASELOAD AND MORTALITY ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

A micro-service data-driven web-application that;

	is open-source solution which is easy to deploy and use, 
	has an interactive dashboard app tracking the number of cases and deaths
	by country,

	predicts the cases for the next 14 days in a country /region selected by the user, 

	incorporates a report generation engine that shows the state of the pandemic worldwide,

	shows the state of vaccinations in Kenya by County and Region.

The objectives of the project were to;
•	Analyze the state of tracking applications and availability of open-source code for their implementation,
•	Design an open-source solution which is easy to deploy and use,
•	Create an interactive dashboard app tracking the number of cases and deaths by country and region,
•	Build a machine learning model, implemented in Python, that predicts the cases for the next 14 days in a country /region selected by the user,
•	Create a daily report generation engine that shows the state of vaccinations worldwide.
